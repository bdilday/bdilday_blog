This blog is created by [Ben Dilday](https://twitter.com/BenDilday). I'm a data scientist in the New York area. Previously I've been a software engineer (focusing on augmented reality applications), an instructor of physics and astronomy, an astrophysicist (studying supernovas and dark energy), and a grad student in Physics (at the University of Chicago).

I created this blog because I realized that the number one thing I'm hoping to find when I venture on to the internet is some cool graphs! Hopefully some math. Code tutorials. Data. I don't really know where to find that on a consistent basis and so I decided to put some stuff out there.
