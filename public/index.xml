      <description>I recently saw a headline saying Aaron Judge now has the record for quickest to 70 home runs from start of a career. This stat is impressive, but also skewed because Judge started in the majors at age 24, which is fairly late for a superstar. A related question that&amp;rsquo;s interesting to ask is, which players had streaks of 1000 PA or so with 70 HR at the youngest ages?</description>

      <description>This post extends the previous one on runs-scored and runs-allowed contours to show a prototype for a graphical standings table. When I look at a standings table what I want to see is
 wins and losses
 winning percentage - how many wins does this prorate to at 162 G?
 runs scored and allowed
 are they beating their Pythagorean record? lagging it?
 are they defense first or offense first?</description>

      <description>This post shows how to scrape the current MLB standings and generate a graph of runs scored and runs allowed contours. I will facet the graph according to division, but still compute the contours using all the data. The trick for making this work is to replicate the data, setting a flag for each division, and then using alpha and size aesthetics to hide the non-relevant data.
Scraping current standings For scraping current standings there are a variety of choices, e.</description>
