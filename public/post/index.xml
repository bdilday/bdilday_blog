      <description>Suppose we have a population with a Normal distribution of some property, $t$, i.e. $t_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma_t$. For each member of the population we make a noisy measurement of the value, where the error distribution is Normal, $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma_i)$. The probability to make an observation $x_i$ is then,
$$ P(x_i | t) ~ \sim \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma_i \sigma_t}
\int d\mu \exp{(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{(x_i - \mu)^2}{\sigma_i^2})} \exp{(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{(\mu - t)^2}{\sigma_t^2})} $$</description>

      <title>Normalization of product of two Gaussians</title>

      <description>In Bayesian statistical analysis it is common to encounter the product of two Gaussian functions, representing the likelihood and the prior for a Normally distributed random variable. As articulated by John D. Cook here, it&amp;rsquo;s usually the case that one doesn&amp;rsquo;t need the normalization factor of the posterior distribution and so it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find a clear reference for what it is. The post by John D. Cook mentioned above does show the result, but the purpose of my post here is to flesh out the math a little bit more, and to state the result i a way I think is more intuitive.</description>

      <title>Catcher Defense with Linear Mixed Effect Models</title>

      <description>In baseball, measuring catcher defense is notoriously tricky. This is because it includes things like pitch framing and game calling that aren&amp;rsquo;t captured in traditional stats sheets. One approach to this is to do a &amp;ldquo;with-or-without you&amp;rdquo; analysis, in other words look at the difference in outcome depending on catcher, holding as many other contributing factors constant as possible. One prominent example of this is Tom Tango&amp;rsquo;s analysis of passed balls and wild pitches - events where the responsibility can reasonably be assumed to be limited to the pitcher and catcher.</description>

      <description>Abbott: &amp;hellip; Well, let&amp;rsquo;s see, we have on the bags, Who&amp;rsquo;s on first, What&amp;rsquo;s on second, I Don&amp;rsquo;t Know is on third&amp;hellip;
Costello: That&amp;rsquo;s what I want to find out.
Abbott: I say Who&amp;rsquo;s on first, What&amp;rsquo;s on second, I Don&amp;rsquo;t Know&amp;rsquo;s on third.
Costello: Are you the manager?
Abbott: Yes.
Costello: You gonna be the coach too?
Abbott: Yes.
Costello: And you don&amp;rsquo;t know the fellows&amp;rsquo; names?</description>

      <title>Facet Wrap with Limit in the Grammar of Graphics?</title>

      <description>I have a case where I want to facet the data, using a subset of the groups. This post looks at how one might do this in ggplot2 and asks how it fits into the grammar of graphics. All work on defining custom stats, geoms, and faceting is based on the expositions in the ggplot2 vignette on extending ggplot  as well as the chapter on ggplot internals from Bob Rudis</description>

      <title>Storytelling With Data (SWD) Challenge: Your Choice Makover</title>

      <description>Introduction: SWDChallenge On her blog and Twitter account, Storytelling With Data, Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic is running a monthly challenge on effective data visualization. Previous challenges have mainly focused on using specific graph types (e.g., square area, bar charts, slopegraphs) or elements (annotation, color). This month the challenge is to remake a less-than-ideal graph. I happen to have one in mind, so I&amp;rsquo;m jumping in to the challenge!
The less-than-ideal graph The graph I&amp;rsquo;m going to remake comes from the Kansas City, MO, citizen satisfaction survey for 2012-2013.</description>

      <title>Closeness Index - One-run games&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>Introduction The last post looked at records in one-run games. It turns out that Baseball Musings offered a alternative way of thinking about it some 8 years ago. The overarching idea here is that one-run games are kind of a proxy for tight games - but there&amp;rsquo;s a difference between a game that&amp;rsquo;s not close, and then the bullpen blows a lead and it ends up at 1-run, versus a game that&amp;rsquo;s close the whole way.</description>

      <description>So far this season the Seattle Mariners have won a historically high number of one-run games. As of this writing they are 21 - 9, and 1/2 game up on the Astros despite having a run-differential of about 100 runs less. This post looks at records in one-run games over the years.

      <title>Home Runs in 1000 PA</title>
      <link>/2018/05/27/home-runs-in-1000-pa/</link>

      <description>I recently saw a headline saying Aaron Judge now has the record for quickest to 70 home runs from start of a career. This stat is impressive, but also skewed because Judge started in the majors at age 24, which is fairly late for a superstar. A related question that&amp;rsquo;s interesting to ask is, which players had streaks of 1000 PA or so with 70 HR at the youngest ages?</description>

      <title>Graphical MLB Standings</title>

      <description>This post extends the previous one on runs-scored and runs-allowed contours to show a prototype for a graphical standings table. When I look at a standings table what I want to see is
 wins and losses
 winning percentage - how many wins does this prorate to at 162 G?
 runs scored and allowed
 are they beating their Pythagorean record? lagging it?
 are they defense first or offense first?</description>

      <title>RS and RA contours with ggplot</title>

      <description>This post shows how to scrape the current MLB standings and generate a graph of runs scored and runs allowed contours. I will facet the graph according to division, but still compute the contours using all the data. The trick for making this work is to replicate the data, setting a flag for each division, and then using alpha and size aesthetics to hide the non-relevant data.
Scraping current standings For scraping current standings there are a variety of choices, e.</description>
